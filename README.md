# Data-Structures
STL Practicing

University project intended to study several data structures, specially binary trees.
Using "make documentacion" you can get all the documentation and explanations in Spanish, 
but I can translate it if requested.

It is made up of sereval abstract data types whose specifications are included.

In broad strokes, we have ingredients which compose sets of ingredients. Then we have a cpp file in which
these data types are tested.
On top of that, we have recipes which are also made up of ingredients but including some extra information.
It also includes sets of recipes.
The last ADTs are actions and instructions. These are ultimately designed to represent a series of steps in order
to create a specific recipe. The way in which they work together is described within the documentation.

I want to highlight again that this explanation is NOT precise whatsoever, and if you want to have a proper one, you should definititely
get it using the makefile or contact me or my partner through e-mail.
